# **Solder Reflow Plate**

###### Forked from AfterEarth Ltd https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate

This is a fork of the AfterEarth Ltd Solder Reflow Plate. The original design is covered by under MIT License. This fork is also covered by the MIT License.

The original design is a great design, but I wanted to make a few changes to add some features as ESP32 control, USB-C power, and a few other small details as SMD thermistors.

Also, having an ESP32 open the door to control the device through wifi with a javascript web interface.

Thanks to the orginal designer!
