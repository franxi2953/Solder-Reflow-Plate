# **Solder Reflow Plate**

###### Forked from AfterEarth Ltd https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate

This is a fork of the AfterEarth Ltd Solder Reflow Plate. The original design is covered by under MIT License so it is my design.

The original is a great tool, but I wanted to make a few changes to add some features as ESP32 control, USB-C power, and a few other small details as SMD thermistors. The idea is to store a webpage inside the esp32 that servesas a control and where the user can draw their own heating curves and tune some other parameters.

I am also planning to print a 3D case in resin (heat resistant) to hold the plate and cover it with a cap, that I imagine will make easier to keep the heat inside the device.

Thanks to the orginal designer!
